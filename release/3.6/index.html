<h1 id="ovirt-360-alpha-release-notes">oVirt 3.6.0 ALPHA Release Notes</h1>

<p>The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 3.6.0 first Alpha release as of May 20th, 2015.</p>

<p>oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization. This release is available now for Fedora 20, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6, CentOS 6.6, (or similar) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1, CentOS 7.1 (or similar).</p>

<p>To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the <a href="/release/">previous versions release notes</a>. For a general overview of oVirt, read <a href="/documentation/quick-start/quick-start-guide/"> the Quick Start Guide</a> and the <a href="/documentation/about-ovirt/">about oVirt</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="openjdk-support">OpenJDK support</h3>

<p>oVirt engine 3.6 requires <span style="color: red;">OpenJDK 1.7</span>, it will not work different version. Please take a look at <a href="#Install_.2F_Upgrade_from_previous_versions"> Install / Upgrade from previous version</a> section how to install properly.</p>

<h3 id="docker-integration">Docker Integration</h3>

<p>oVirt Engine setup now provides <a href="/feature/cinderglance-docker-integration/"> Cinder and Glance</a> automated deployment using Docker</p>

<h3 id="self-hosted-engine-fc-support">Self Hosted Engine FC Support</h3>

<p>Hosted Engine has now added support for <a href="/feature/engine/self-hosted-engine-fc-support/">FC storage</a></p>

<h3 id="self-hosted-engine-gluster-support">Self Hosted Engine Gluster Support</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Hosted Engine has now added support for <a href="/feature/engine/self-hosted-engine-gluster-support/">Gluster storage</a></li>
  <li>Hosted Engine has now added support for <a href="/feature/engine/self-hosted-engine-hyper-converged-gluster-support/">Hyper Converged Gluster storage</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ovirt-live">oVirt Live</h3>

<p>oVirt Live has been rebased on CentOS 7 allowing to run oVirt in 3.6 compatibility mode</p>

<h3 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Due to an issue with VDSM, ISO domains cannot be connected</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li>The engine fails with openjdk 1.8. Until this is fixed, workaround is to install java-1.7.0-openjdk, and make it default with update-alternatives, or just remove java-1.8.0-openjdk.</li>
  <li>This means that the engine is not supported on Fedora &gt;= 21 (which does not have java-1.7.0-openjdk).</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li>Use SELinux Permissive mode in order to avoid denials using VDSM and Gluster</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>NFS startup on EL7 / Fedora20: due to other bugs ( or ), NFS service is not always able to start at first attempt (it doesn't wait the kernel module to be ready); if it happens oVirt engine setup detects it and aborts with</p>

    <p>[ INFO  ] Restarting nfs services
  [ ERROR ] Failed to execute stage 'Closing up': Command '/bin/systemctl' failed to execute</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Retrying (engine-cleanup, engine-setup again) it's enough to avoid it cause the kernel module it's always ready on further attempts. Manually starting NFS service (/bin/systemctl restart nfs-server.service) before running engine setup it's enough to avoid it at all.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>NFS startup on EL7.1 requires manual startup of rpcbind.service before running engine setup in order to avoid</p>

    <p>[ INFO  ] Restarting nfs services
  [ ERROR ] Failed to execute stage 'Closing up': Command '/bin/systemctl' failed to execute</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upgrade of All-in-One on EL6 and FC20 are not going to be supported in 3.6. VDSM and the packages requiring it are not built anymore for EL6 and FC20.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alpha-release">ALPHA RELEASE</h3>

<p>oVirt 3.6.0 Alpha release is available since 2015-05-06. In order to install it you've to enable oVirt 3.6 pre release repository.</p>

<p>In order to install it on a clean system, you need to run (see also <a href="#Known_Issues">Known Issues</a> above):</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>  # yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk `# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm)&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>If you are upgrading from a previous version, you may have the ovirt-release35 package already installed on your system. You can then install ovirt-release36.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.</p>

<p>Once ovirt-release36 package is installed, you will have the ovirt-3.6-pre repository and any other repository needed for satisfying dependencies enabled by default.</p>

<p>If you're installing oVirt 3.6.0 Alpha on a clean host, you should read our <a href="/documentation/quick-start/quick-start-guide/">Quick Start Guide</a>.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from oVirt &lt; 3.5.0, you must first upgrade to oVirt 3.5.0 or later. Please see <a href="/release/3.5.2/">oVirt 3.5.2 release notes</a> for upgrade instructions.</p>

<p>For upgrading now you just need to execute:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>  # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"&#x000A;  # engine-setup&#x000A;</code></pre>

<h3 id="ovirt-hosted-engine">oVirt Hosted Engine</h3>

<p>If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please follow <a href="/howto/hosted-engine/#Fresh_Install">Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install</a> guide.</p>

<p>If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow <a href="/howto/hosted-engine/#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine">Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine</a> guide.</p>
